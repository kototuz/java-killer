# Java Killer

A set of toolchains that will kill Java and other JVM languages.

## Introduction

JVM languages are slow (especially Kotlin). This languages are mess.
I want to have simple and fast languages. So the goal of this project
is to explore JVM class format and try to create toolchains and languages
without boolshit using godly **C Programming Language**.

## Toolchains

- **jasm** - an assembler
